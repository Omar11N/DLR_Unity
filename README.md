AI Friends

Welcome to AI Friends – a YouTube channel dedicated to exploring the fascinating world of artificial intelligence through the lens of multi-agent systems and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Whether you’re an AI enthusiast, a researcher, or a developer eager to dive into advanced topics, our channel is your go-to resource for cutting-edge content and hands-on tutorials.
What We Do

At AI Friends, we showcase how multi-agent systems learn to master interesting and complex tasks using state-of-the-art DRL techniques and imitation learning. Our content covers:

    Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: We explore how multiple agents interact, cooperate, and compete in dynamic environments.
    Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL): Learn how DRL algorithms empower agents to make decisions from raw data and complex sensory inputs.
    Imitation Learning: Discover how agents learn by mimicking expert behavior to accelerate training and improve performance.
    Algorithm Deep Dive: We work with advanced algorithms such as PPO, SAC, and POCA, breaking down their inner workings and practical applications.
    From Code to Deployment: Our tutorials span the entire workflow—from creating environments in C# and defining Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), to shaping reward functions and training your agents on challenging tasks.

Our Approach

We believe that learning AI should be both informative and fun. On our channel, you’ll find:

    Hands-on Coding Tutorials: Step-by-step guides where we build and deploy intelligent agents using real-world tools and libraries.
    In-Depth Explanations: We break down complex concepts like multi-agent coordination, self-play, and deep imitation learning in an accessible manner.
    Project Showcases: Watch our agents tackle tasks ranging from game simulations to advanced robotics challenges.
    Latest Trends & Research: Stay updated with modern techniques and breakthroughs that are shaping the future of AI.

Technologies We Use

    Programming Language: C# – for robust environment creation, MDP definition, and seamless integration with simulation tools.
    Frameworks & Libraries: We utilize modern libraries and frameworks (like Unity, TensorFlow.NET, and others) to build, train, and evaluate our models.
    Algorithms: From PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) to SAC (Soft Actor-Critic) and POCA, we implement various algorithms to demonstrate their unique advantages.
